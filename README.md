GunSmoke

Technical documentation on the GunSmoke arcade game.

This repository contains files created as part of my personal study of digital electronics and emulation of arcade games.
I'm documenting the 1985 GunSmoke game circuit board by drawing schematics of it using KiCAD.
I'm also learning emulation by comparing the circuitry of the game board to the MAME emulation of the game.
